<p>When I started to use PyCharm CE (Community Edition; Free) other than finding that it is a really good IDE, personally it’s better than using my favorite text editor, I found out that it had problems with non-QWERTY keyboard layouts as well. Since I’m using the Dvorak keyboard layout, (something that’s not QWERTY) I was in a trouble.</p>

<p>The problem is that, normally, every JetBrains’ IDEs have problems with key-binding if you’re not using the QWERTY keyboard layout. The symtom is it mixes up the QWERTY’s key-binding with your layout’s key-binding. <strong>This will surely confuse you!</strong></p>

<p>I did a lot of research, (something like 30 minutes googling) and finally found something that can compensate this. Note that it <em>doesn’t</em> perfectly solve this problem, <em>they said</em>, but for me it <em>does</em> solve my problem very well.</p>

<p>The solution is here: (<a href="https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-63779#comment=27-841611">original post</a>)</p>

<p>In short, you just have to make change to your registry settings like this: (because it’s not enabled by default)</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>ide.non.english.keyboard.layout.fix=true
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>However, it’s not that easy to do so. (it’s something more advanced settings) You have to follow <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11829434/local-history-configuration-in-intellij-idea-11/11829639#11829639">this link</a> to gain access to that settings.</p>

<p>I have <em>copied</em> it here:</p>

      <td>Another way is to use <code class="highlighter-rouge">Help</code></td>
      <td><code class="highlighter-rouge">Find Action</code>, type <strong>Registry</strong> in the box, ensure that <code class="highlighter-rouge">Include non-menu actions</code> option is enabled, select the <strong>Registry</strong> result from the list, press <strong>Enter</strong></td>
