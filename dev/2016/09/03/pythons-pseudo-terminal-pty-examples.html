<h4 id="a-new-approach">A new approach</h4>

<p>I restarted myself in knowing this. I intended to attach a pty (pseudo terminal) onto a command of my choice, including <code class="highlighter-rouge">docker</code></p>

<p>It’s not trivial though, at least for me, to understand how to use <strong>Python’s PTY</strong> library. I just didn’t have the knowledge of how pty would take part in the whole process.</p>

<p>A lot of googling had been done, I read a blog (http://sqizit.bartletts.id.au/2011/02/14/pseudo-terminals-in-python/) I think I owe the writer to some extent. After gazing at the code, I finally grasped its algorithm, the pty’s place in the code, and how does it interact with the rest.</p>

<p>General way of using Python’s PTY is something like this:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>use <code class="highlighter-rouge">fork</code> to create another process that is attached with pseudo terminal (so it can run those exceptional commands), called this a child process.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>at the <code class="highlighter-rouge">child</code> process, we will just execute a command of our choice in the way that can be a bit destructive like <code class="highlighter-rouge">os.execlp(..)</code> this kind of statement will terminate itself from being python to the designated process completely (and never to return).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>at the <code class="highlighter-rouge">master</code>, the master will know the child’s pid, and child’s stdin file descriptor (fd). The latter is extremely helpful it’s a pipe of bi-direction. <strong>Writing from it is the same as writing to the child’s stdin, and reading from it is the same as reading from the child’s stdout</strong>.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>If you want, as I do, to read child’s stdout and duplicate this, one, to the master’s stdout and, second, to a variable. Your algorithm will be something like this:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>use <code class="highlighter-rouge">select.select</code> command to watch a pipe of child’s stdin fd.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>if there is anything output from the child, we will read it from the pipe.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>prints it through master’s stdout, and also writes it to a variable of your choice.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>And thats’s how you do it!</p>

<h4 id="one-more-thing">One more thing</h4>

<p>The approach I just mentioned including the website I posted doesn’t show how to get the <strong>exitcode</strong> after the command has run. Actually, I found no way to get it using the current knowledge I have. So, I yield to a more robust library like <code class="highlighter-rouge">ptyprocess</code>, I think you should consider using it because the developer has put so much effort to make it as platform independent as possible.</p>
